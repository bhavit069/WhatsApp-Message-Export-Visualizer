8/19/24, 12:59 AM - Bhavit is a contact
10/10/24, 9:51 PM - Bhavit: hey guys, bhavit here
10/10/24, 9:51 PM - Bhavit: so, weekend plans?
10/10/24, 9:52 PM - Bhavit: I was thinking we could go for a hike, what do you think?
10/10/24, 9:52 PM - Ankit: A hike? In this weather? Are you serious?
10/10/24, 9:52 PM - Ankit: I’d rather stay home and game all day.
10/10/24, 9:53 PM - Bhavit: Nah, it’ll be fun. Fresh air, nature, all that! We can grab lunch after.
10/10/24, 9:53 PM - Geeth: I dunno... what if I get tired on the hike?
10/10/24, 9:53 PM - Geeth: I’ll need a break every 10 minutes...
10/10/24, 9:53 PM - Geeth: I really need my load balancer to handle this!
10/10/24, 9:54 PM - Bhavit: Load balancer?? What do you mean? It’s a hike, not a server problem.
10/10/24, 9:54 PM - Geeth: You know... for distributing the load... like, on my legs... and heart.
10/10/24, 9:54 PM - Ankit: Hah! Maybe we can get a load balancer for your mood swings too, Geeth.
10/10/24, 9:54 PM - Geeth: Hey! I’m just being prepared!
10/10/24, 9:55 PM - Bhavit: Okay, okay, we’ll take it easy. A short hike, then lunch. Does that work for everyone?
10/10/24, 9:55 PM - Ankit: As long as I’m not carrying any of your gear, sure.
10/10/24, 9:55 PM - Geeth: Wait, can we also have a back-up plan for if it rains? Or my load balancer might break!
10/10/24, 9:55 PM - Bhavit: Sure, we’ll have a plan B. No worries.
10/10/24, 9:56 PM - Bhavit: I’m actually excited for this, let’s go!
10/10/24, 9:56 PM - Geeth: Fine... but only if I can bring my portable charger.
